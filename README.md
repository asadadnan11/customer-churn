## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry. Using advanced algorithms and comprehensive data analysis, it identifies high-risk customers and quantifies the business impact of proactive retention strategies.

**Business Context**: Customer churn costs telecom companies billions annually. This solution enables data-driven retention decisions by predicting which customers are most likely to leave and calculating the ROI of intervention strategies.

**Key Deliverables**:
- High-performance churn prediction models (87%+ AUC)
- Comprehensive business impact analysis with ROI calculations
- Dashboard-ready dataset for real-time monitoring
- Actionable insights for customer retention strategies
